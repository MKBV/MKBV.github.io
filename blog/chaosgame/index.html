and my love of superior math was amazed by <a href="https://youtu.be/IGlGvSXkRGI">the video</a>.</p>
<p>Processes mentioned on video:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a shape.</li>
<li>Pick a random point from the inside of the shape</li>
<li>Pick a random corner and put a dot at the midpoint of these two points.</li>
<li>Do the 3rd process for the new dot.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="writing-the-script">Writing the Script</h1>
<p>When writing these operations to the code, we need to define certain algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we understand the random point was in the shape?</li>
<li>When our shape has 4 or more corners, we need to dismiss some corners.* How?</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I use the turtle module for the graphical interface.<br>
It&rsquo;s really simple and I can draw shapes by just use some coordinates.</p>
<p>To pick a random point from inside of the shape, I use that algorithm:</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/blog/img/caos_area.jpg" alt="Areas"  />
</p>
</p>
<p>If we draw triangles with a random point and 2 corners, the area of triangles must be equal to the area of the shape.<br>
Nor the point isn&rsquo;t inside of the shape.</p>
<p><code>1+2+3+4 == Area of Squere</code></p>
<p>Then we chose a random corner and find the midpoint between the corner and the point.<br>
That is the easiest part of the code. Because has a simple math formula.<br>
And when we put dots to midpoints, the script must be finished.</p>
<p>After a while of this progression, I got shapes like these.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/blog/img/caos_exp.jpg" alt="Images"  />
</p>
</p>
<h1 id="4-corner-problem">4+ Corner Problem</h1>
<p>That algorithm is perfectly run at the triangle, but if the shape has 4 or more corners we&rsquo;ll see a miscorrect pattern.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/blog/img/caos_faulty.png" alt="unchanged algorithm with sqruare"  />
</p>
</p>
<p>You can change the pattern by changing the corner order.<br>
If we chose a different corner from the last process there won&rsquo;t appear a misspattern. <strong>(Example 2nd )</strong><br>
Or you can dismiss the next corner <strong>(Example 3rd)</strong> or the next 2nd corner <strong>(Example 4th)</strong>.</p>
